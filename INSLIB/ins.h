 *
 * @brief 15/18-state error-state Kalman filter for 3D navigation.
 *
 * State vector:
 *   [0..2]   Position error in n-frame (NED) [m]
 *   [3..5]   Velocity error in n-frame (NED) [m/s]
 *   [6..8]   Attitude error (small-angle rpy) [rad]
 *   [9..11]  Accelerometer bias [m/s^2]
 *   [12..14] Gyroscope bias [rad/s]
 *   Optional:
 *   [15..17] Magnetometer bias [uT or mT]
 *
 * Covariance is stored as a UDU factorisation (U is 15x15 unit upper
 * triangular, d is a 15x1 diagonal vector). Fusion uses the
 * Bierman/Thornton "square root" routines from kalman_udu.h.
 *
 * Nominal state (all single precision, the filter works in a local n-frame):
 *   - pos_local in n-frame (NED), relative to the origin set at init
 *   - vel in n-frame (NED)
 *   - qbn Hamilton quaternion (body-to-NED)
 *   - acc/gyr bias in body frame
 *
 * Double precision is only used for the absolute-position anchor: the n-frame
 * origin (origin_llh) and the current lat/lon/height (latlonh, book-kept
 * incrementally from the float n-frame deltas), both geodetic. The hot path
 * (strapdown, predict, fusion corrections) is float-only, and ECEF is a form
 * of the interface rather than of the filter: it is converted where a caller
 * hands one in or asks for one, never per epoch (REQ-NAV-080).
 *
 * The filter keeps a ring-buffer history of recent states to support delayed
 * GNSS measurements (time-of-validity up to INS_MAX_DELAY_MS in the past).
 *
 * All memory is allocated as part of the ins_t struct - no heap is used.
