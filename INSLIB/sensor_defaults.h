 *
 * @brief Shared fallback defaults for quantities that ins.c, ahrs.c and
 *        baro_alt.c genuinely share: the gyro noise model of a low-cost
 *        consumer MEMS IMU, plus a handful of cross-filter statistics
 *        (stillness gate, chi2 significance, mag field tolerance) that
 *        describe the same physical question in more than one filter.
 *
 * Used as the fallback when the caller leaves the corresponding config
 * field at 0/unset: enough to get a stable filter without any sensor
 * characterization. Replace with the sensor's actual datasheet noise
 * figures whenever available. A better (lower-noise) part left at these
 * defaults will just be fused a bit too cautiously.
 *
 * Deliberately project-specific (ins/ahrs/baro_alt share one physical IMU in
 * nav_suite): unlike geodetic_toolbox.h, this header is NOT meant to be
 * portable to other projects, so it must not be pulled into
 * geodetic_toolbox.h.
 *
 * Only truly shared quantities live here - each consuming file keeps a
 * locally-named macro that aliases the constant below, and defaults that are
 * NOT shared stay local to their own .c file. In particular there is no shared
 * accelerometer *noise* default: every filter that uses one treats it as a
 * different physical quantity. ins.c has its own VRW density ("pure" sensor
 * spec). ahrs.c fuses it as a discrete leveling correction whose noise term
 * doubles as a maneuver-rejection margin. baro_alt.c's "accelerometer" input is
 * actually a full attitude-projected vertical acceleration, so its noise
 * absorbs roll/pitch projection error on top of the raw sensor; its implied
 * density is several times ins.c's, empirically not interchangeable. ins.c's
 * own chi2 gate is likewise one shared value since REQ-NAV-046, but NOT this
 * file's INS_DEFAULT_CHI2_95_1DOF: it keeps its own, looser
 * INS_DEFAULT_CHI2_GATE, because the stricter 3.8415 was seen to destabilize
 * yaw under a sustained gross GNSS-velocity mismatch.

 *  The primary criterion is the sample VARIANCE over a short tumbling window,

 *  the spread, so a magnitude-only gate reads a biased but perfectly stationary
 *  IMU as "moving". That is self-locking - the detector is what feeds the

 *  accelerometer bias state at all, so there the block is permanent).
