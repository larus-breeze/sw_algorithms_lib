 *
 * @brief Attitude (and heading) reference system Kalman Filter.
 *
 * An error-state Kalman filter that corrects an attitude quaternion and a
 * gyroscope bias vector with accelerometer (leveling) and optional magnetometer
 * (heading) measurements. Runs standalone next to the full ins filter (see
 * nav_suite.h for a wrapper that runs both).
 *
 * Two modes:
 *  - AHRS_MODE_ARS ("directional gyro"): roll/pitch filter. Yaw is integrated
 *    from the gyroscope but never corrected, i.e. it drifts with the
 *    (estimated) z gyro bias error.
 *    Error state (5): [droll dpitch dbg_x dbg_y dbg_z]
 *  - AHRS_MODE_AHRS: roll/pitch/yaw filter. Yaw is stabilized with
 *    tilt-compensated magnetometer heading measurements. The heading reference
 *    is magnetic north until a position is supplied via ahrs_set_position(),
 *    after which the World Magnetic Model declination is added and the
 *    estimated yaw is relative to TRUE north.
 *    Error state (6): [droll dpitch dyaw dbg_x dbg_y dbg_z]
 *
 * Angular rates and accelerometer measurements are expected in the body frame
 * with X forward (roll axis), Y right (pitch axis), Z down (yaw axis), right
 * hand convention. Attitude output is body-to-NED (Tait-Bryan ZYX).
 *
 * Reasonable defaults for the sensor noise model are provided (any config field
 * left at 0 is replaced by its default), but for optimal performance supply the
 * sensor specific noise and bias random walk parameters.
 *
 * Zero-rotation update (ZARU, opt-in, ahrs_update's zero_rotation_update
 * parameter): a caller-supplied "we know omega_b_nb == 0 this epoch" flag fuses
 * a direct gyro-bias measurement. Unlike ins, this filter has no
 * position/velocity state, so it cannot detect stillness on its own; the
 * trigger must come from outside (nav_suite passes through ins's own
 * velocity-aware auto-ZUPT/ZARU detector).
 *
 * Notes:
 *  - The Earth rotation rate (15 deg/h) is not corrected.
 *  - Make sure the initial attitude is roughly correct, otherwise the filter
 *    takes a while to converge. Use ahrs_leveling_from_acc() /
 *    ahrs_mag_heading() on a static sample.
 *  - The accelerometer influence is tuned with acc_freq_hz: too low and the
 *    gyro bias tracking suffers, too high and acceleration phases corrupt the
 *    attitude.
 *
 * All memory is part of the ahrs_t struct - no heap is used.
